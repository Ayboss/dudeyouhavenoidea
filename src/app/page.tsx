        Hi, I’m Lawal Ayobami, a Computer Engineer with 4 years of experience in software development and about 1 year in IoT. I’ve been a Frontend Engineer, Backend Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Mobile Engineer... basically, if it’s code, I’ve probably done it—sometimes even things I’m not sure have a name!
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
        Outside of the technical world, I have a range of hobbies that keep life interesting—drawing, playing the guitar, and even dabbling in close-up magic and sleight of hand. I might not be a pro at any of them, but hey, I give it my all! 🎨🎸✨
