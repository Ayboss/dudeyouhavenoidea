        Hi, Iâ€™m Lawal Ayobami, a Computer Engineer with 4 years of experience in software development and about 1 year in IoT. Iâ€™ve been a Frontend Engineer, Backend Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Mobile Engineer... basically, if itâ€™s code, Iâ€™ve probably done itâ€”sometimes even things Iâ€™m not sure have a name!
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
        Outside of the technical world, I have a range of hobbies that keep life interestingâ€”drawing, playing the guitar, and even dabbling in close-up magic and sleight of hand. I might not be a pro at any of them, but hey, I give it my all! ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¸âœ¨
